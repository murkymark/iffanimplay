Source file overview
--------------------

Modules:
 *gui - gui system based on SDL
  font
  unistring
  unisurface
 
 *player - main application module, connects to gui and libs
 
 *decoder
  libiffanimplay
  libcdxl




iffanimplay:
------------
"main.cpp" - start of player, contains "main()" function

"player/player.cpp|.h" -  player core

"player/player_decwrapper.cpp" - player class methods that wrap the loaders/decoder, hence separated from "player.cpp"

"player/player_gui.cpp|.h" - window/graphical output and input (events), derived from gui, adds player specific gui code

"player/scale.c|.h" - generic scale functions

"player/system_specific.h/cpp" - OS dependent code



gui: (SDL based GUI system)
----



decoders:
---------
 "decoder\amiga_conv.c/.h"  - Generic Amiga related conversion functions (shared by CDXL and IffAnim decoders)

 "decoder\safemem.cpp/hpp" - makes sure all memory accesses stay inside allocated memory boundary (skip or throw exception upon illegal access)
                      DLTA compressions use stored offsets/pointers which may lead to crashes if data is corrupt
                      includes byte order conversion methods

 CDXL:
  "decoder/cdxl/cdxl.cpp|.h"    - CDXL class

 IFF-ANIM:
  "decoder/iffanim/iffanim.cpp|.h" - IFFANIM class
