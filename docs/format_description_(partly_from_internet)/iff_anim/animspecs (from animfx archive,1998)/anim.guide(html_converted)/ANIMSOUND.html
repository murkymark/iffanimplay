The ANIM-Format is a wellknown fileformat for animations but it doesn´t
exists a standard for animation with sound.

The softwarepackage WaveTracer DS® (by  VIRTUAL WORLDS Productions®) gives
users much possibilities to create good sounds, also in Dolby-Surround®.
The WaveTracer DS® together with the included CineTracer® makes it possible
to create sounds out of the datafiles of a raytracer. These sounds can
be injected into a ANIM-file. A player wich knows how (e.g. the
AnimFX®-Player, also by Virtual Worlds Productions) can play these anims
with sound.
