<PRE>   SBDY Chunk
   ----------

The samplechunk SBDY includes all sampledata wich have to be played back for
the actual frame. Every SBDY chunk includes only a small part of the whole
sample and every part fits to its frame. If you use the correct playback-
speed, you can use the sample-playbacktime for synchronising your anim-
playbackspeed.

The organisation of the SBDY chunk depends on the definitions in SXHD chunk.
The most important examples have following structure:

Sampledepth: 8 Bit
Mode: Mono
   Sampledata are stored like in normal 8SVX-format, UBYTE by UBYTE and
   only one channel.

Sampledepth: 8 Bit
Mode Stereo
   Here Sampledata are also stored like in normal Stereo-8SVX-Format, first
   all UBYTEs for the left channel and then all for the right channel.


* NOTE! The last frame of a ANIM could have two SBDY chunks. The first one
* has to be played like all others when the last frame is displayed. The
* second Frame includes sampledata wich often have an other length. These
* sampledata have to be played after the end of the animation (e.g. when
* the screen fades to an other).
* If you have a looped ANIM, ignore these additional SBDY-Chunk. You have
* to playback the data of these chunk if you leave the ANIM after the last
* loop.

NOTE ALSO! In future there can be programs wich support ANIMs with sound. If
such a program merges two ANIMs with sound, it can happen, that a frame
in the middle of the complete animation owns two SBDY-Chunks. Then you have
to do following: Replay the second SBDY with your normal two channels (could
be Amiga®-channels A and B) and start immediately replaying the next frame
with its SBDY-Sounddata onto the other two channels (the Amiga®-channels
D and C). So you will get the perfect fading from one part of a animation
to the other (it should look and sound nearly like in good movies!).
