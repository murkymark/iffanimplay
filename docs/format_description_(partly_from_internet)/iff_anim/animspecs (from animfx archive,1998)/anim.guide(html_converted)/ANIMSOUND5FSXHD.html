<PRE>   SXHD Chunk
   ----------

This chunk includes all informations about the soundsample. It isn´t
compatible to the VHDR-chunk in the 8SVX format but its the same like in
HISX-soundformats of our product WaveTracer®. For more detailed
informations about these format, its usage and its soundmodes, see the
original WaveTracer®-Manual and the WaveTracer® Developers-Information.

*  UBYTE SampleDepth  depth of the Sample in unit Bits, most common is 8
                      but all others from 1 Bit up to 32 Bits are
                      (theoretical) possible
*  UBYTE FixedVolume  Amiga-typical unit for playback-volume, 0 is off and
                      64 is maximum
*  UBYTE Length       length of a SBDY-chunk of ONE frame. This length is
                      calculated for a constant playbackspeed. If speed
                      varies from frame to frame the length of the
                      SBDY-samplechunk also varies and this value is
                      invalid and/or set to 0
   LONG PlayRate      Amiga-typical unit for playback-speed; if you like to
                      use the duration of sampleplayback for the synchroni-
                      sation of the anim-playrate or if you use a soundcard,
                      you better should use "PlayFreq"
   LONG CompressionMethod   has to be =0 in anims everytime, because the
                      AnimPlayer became slower and Dolby-Surround®-
                      informations will be destroyed by all known
                      compressions
*  UBYTE UsedChannels Flag for number and type of channels saved in the
                      SBDY-chunk:
                          1 - Channel left
                          2 - Channel right
                          4 - Channel center
                      Left and right together or center are supported this
                      time, but following channels are theoretical also
                      possible:
                          8 - Surroundchannel or surround left
                         16 - Surround right
                         32 - Subwoofer effectchannel
*  UBYTE UsedMode     says, wich soundmode has to be used:
                          1: Mode Mono (center-channel only)
                          2: Mode Stereo (channels left and right)
                      Following modes are also possible but not supported
                      yet:
                          3 - 3.0 3Channel
                          4 - 4.0 DTS®-Quadro
                          5 - 4.0 DolbySurround®
                          6 - 5.0 DTS® / AC-3®
                          7 - 5.1 DTS® / AC-3®
   LONG PlayFreq      play-/samplefrequency, spezifies the correct playspeed
*  UWORD Loop         Number of loops; says how often anim has to be repeated
*                     after first playback
*                     Loop=0 - No loop, leave the anim with the last frame
*                     Loop&gt;0 - Loop, repeat the anim for "Loop" times
*                     NOTE: if it is a looped anim, the first two frames
*                           have been appended to the end of the anim AND
*                           these frames include sounddata!
