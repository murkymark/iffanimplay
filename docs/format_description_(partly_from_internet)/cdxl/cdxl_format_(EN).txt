CDXL consists of a simple concatenation of frame chunks:

  HEADER [of frame x]
  COLORMAPDATA
  BITMAPDATA   [UNCOMPRESSED BODY]
  SOUNDDATA    [UNCOMPRESSED BODY]

  HEADER [of frame x+1]
  ...



CDXL - Data types
    BYTE   8 Bit unsigned integer
    WORD  16 Bit unsigned integer, `Motorola`-Byte-Sex
    LONG  32 Bit unsigned integer, `Motorola`-Byte-Sex



[offs: 00..01] Header
{
 [offs: 0] BYTE: CDXL-Format description [1 byte]
  one of the following:
   0x00   CUSTOM CDXL
   0x01   STANDARD CDXL
   0x02   SPECIAL CDXL


 [offs: 1] BYTE: The CDXL-Info-Byte emerge by addition (binary OR) of the three description goups
  video encoding: bit mask 0x03
   0x00   RGB   [1..8 bits per pixel with palette or higher modes without palette]
   0x01   HAM   [HAM6 or HAM8]
   0x02   YUV   [???]
   0x03   AVM & DCTV  [???]
  plus
  Pixel orientation: bit mask 0xE0
   0x00   BIT PLANAR   [each bit of a pixel on another plane -> standart Amiga hardware related]
   0x20   BYTE PLANAR  [??? would be only useful for 16 or 24 bits, if it is analogous to BIT PLANAR]
   0x40   CHUNKY       [all bits of a pixel following one another]
   0x80   BIT LINE     [???]
   0xC0   BYTE LINE    [???]
  plus
  Audio values: bit mask 0x10
   0x00   MONO   [8 bit single channel]
   0x10   STEREO [8 bit 2 channels]


 [offs: 02] LONG:  CURRENT CHUNKSIZE (in BYTE, completely with header)

[offs: 32..63] [COLORMAP] ; The pens are always WORD-coded with preceding "0"s
                            i.e. each color entry has 12 Bit (4096 different colors).

[offs: 64..x] BITMAPDATA (raw)

[offs: x+1..y] SOUNDDATA (raw)



[offs: y+1]  start of chunk header of next frame

Note: playback speed is not saved within the file (it might be imaginable that a creation programm may use one of the reserved fields)




Tables (examples)
-----------------
Dimension table for different constant playing rates:

At 300 KB/sec. approximately 36 minutes of animation would fit on an ISO CD Rome [ 640 Mb ], which corresponds approximately to half of the video CD [ MPEG-1 ~ 72 min. in 384x280x24 ].

[ 1:1 ] 180x180 in HAM6 with 12 FPS and 8 bits mono in 11.025 kH
[ 5:4 ] PAL 200x164 in HAM6 with 12 FPS and 8 bits mono in 11.025 kH
[ 4:3 ] VGA 208x158 in HAM6 with 12 FPS and 8 bits mono in 11.025 kH
